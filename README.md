## stroke prediction
Stroke is one of the major causes of death and injury in the world. Stroke is the second leading cause of death in Korea. The Korean population is steadily ageing; the number of people aged 60 years and older is expected to rise from 13.7 percent in 2015 to 28.6 percent by 2050. Stroke occurrence grows with age. Stroke victims have longer hospital visits, higher re-admission rates, and higher treatment costs than non-stroke patients.
